He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.

How are you, Mom?"", 'There are still things I have to do.', 'Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.

I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.
