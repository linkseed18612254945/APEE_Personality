Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.", "Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...", "Yes... Yes, let's go in.", "Yes! The workhouse!", "Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.", "No, he's very upset about something.", "We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.", "I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?", "I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.", "Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.", "Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.", "Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...", "Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.", "You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.", "Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.", "A dressing bag.", "Yes.

It's a good spot for it.", "I don't have to. I've got them right here.", "No.", "If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.", "And then?", "Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?", "When did you first find out he was alive?", "Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?", "And Laszlo?", "All except one. He won't have you.", "All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.", "No, not yet.", "Everything is quite all right.", "Because you're getting on that plane.", "I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.", "-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.", "-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?", "I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.", "Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.", "We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.", "And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...", "She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.", "How do you do?", "And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.", "And I congratulate you.", "Your work.", "We all try. You succeed.", "Not at all.", "Any time.", "Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.", "Good evening.", "I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.", "Go ahead.", "My office.", "I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.", "What of it?", "Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.", "I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.", "My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.", "There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.", "I said, ask your wife.", "Well, this might come in handy.", "Had a close one, eh?", "Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?", "What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.", "Yes, I get the point.", "You seem to know all about my destiny.", "You love her that much?", "Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.", "Keep it. You'll need it in America.", "Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?", "Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.", "All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.", "I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.", "But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?", "Here it is.", "Hello, Louis.", "When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.", "Why? What's in Lisbon?", "It was a combination of all three.", "My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.", "I was misinformed.", "What, again?", "I stick my neck out for nobody.", "Our entertainment is enough.", "I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.", "Yeah? Have a brandy?", "I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.", "Yeah? What's his name?", "Victor Laszlo?", "Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.", "It'll be interesting to see how he manages.", "His escape.", "-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.", "Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.", "I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.", "Okay.", "Why two?", "He'll take one.", "Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.", "Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?", "And got well paid for it on both occasions.", "Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.", "Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.", "Yeah, you were saying?", "Oh, how do you do?", "I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.", "-- Hello, Ilsa.", "-- Thanks. I will.", "Oh, it's my party.", "That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.", "Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?", "Well, it looks like you're a little late.", "So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.", "Yeah? Why?", "Put it down as a gesture to love.", "How can you close me up? On what grounds?", "But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.", "-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?", "Well, they're all excellent reasons.", "You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.", "And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.", "Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.", "Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?", "Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.", "I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.", "Well, she isn't just any woman.", "I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.", "Oh, thanks.", "You're late.", "I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.", "Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.", "I have the letters right here.", "Sam's piano.", "-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.", "I have. Sit down over there.", "I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.", "Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.", "If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.", "And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.", "Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.", "Anyway, thanks for helping me out.", "As soon as the plane goes, Louis.", "Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.", "My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.", "Our expenses?", "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.", "That's so long ago, I don't remember.", "I never make plans that far ahead.", "Sacha, she's had enough.", "-- Sacha, call a cab.", "Make it official, if you like.", "I'm a drunkard.", "There seems to be no secret about that.", "It's not particularly my beloved Paris.", "Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.", "I haven't the slightest idea.", "Are my eyes really brown?", "My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.", "Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.", "I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.", "Put that phone down!", "Put it down!", "Hello Ugarte.", "Well, what makes you think I haven't?", "-- You thought what?", "They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.", "No.", "If I gave you any thought, I probably would.", "For a price, Ugarte, for a price.", "I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.", "Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?", "For how long?", "I don't want them here overnight.", "Don't be a fool. You can't get away.", "Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.", "He'll double what I pay you.", "Sorry.", "Yeah?", "Not right now.", "No.", "No.", "Good. Then have a drink.", "Then don't have a drink.", "No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.", "She's coming back. I know she's coming back.", "Shut up and go home, will you?", "They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?", "Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?", "I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.", "What's that you're playing?", "Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.", "You played it for her and you can play it for me.", "If she can stand it, I can. Play it!", "You said it!

Maybe an even hundred.", "I'll throw that in too.", "Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.", "Curly, you know how long I been in business.", "So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.", "Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...", "There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.", "That's a filthy habit.", "Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.", "Sue the shit out of 'em.", "I've been wanting to meet you.", "Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?", "Well you own a lot of land.", "Where did you get this material?", "The apple core?", "How do they do that?", "But what?", "How are you, Lou?", "Summer colds are the worst.", "Thanks, Lou.", "Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.", "I get by.", "Since when?", "Congratulations.", "Looking for someone.", "Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?", "I'd like to talk to him.", "No.", "No.", "No?", "You mean that's what you're going to call it.", "Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?", "Didn't you call?", "I don't.", "Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.", "I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.", "What pictures?", "Yeah?", "I heard it was an accident.", "You accusing me of extortion?", "I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.", "Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.", "Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?", "Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.", "He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.", "C'mon I'll show you.", "It's too late.", "They only dump the water at night.", "Matter of fact I do.", "Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.", "She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.", "What for?", "Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.", "Yeah.", "Do me a favor, will you, Lou?", "I guess not.", "Gee, thanks, Lou.", "Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.", "Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.", "Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.", "Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.", "An accident?", "Not that Mulwray?", "Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...", "What are you having?", "Yeah. Fine, thank you.", "Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.", "Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.", "I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.", "What?", "Mrs. Mulwray?", "I don't want to drop it.", "I should talk this over with your husband.", "Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.", "You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.", "May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?", "Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.", "Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --", "Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?", "Looks like you went quite a distance.", "I'll stop by.", "Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.", "You left your keys in the ignition.", "A check?", "I got your check in the mall.", "Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.", "Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.", "I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.", "Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.", "If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.", "How did you find out?", "He told you?", "And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?", "You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.", "Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.", "She's cheating on him.", "Did you have affairs?", "Did he know?", "Where you were when your husband died.", "You mean you don't know where you were?", "You were seeing someone, too.", "For very long?", "That your maiden name?", "No reason.", "No. I'm just a snoop.", "No, not for that one.", "Been meaning to talk to you about that.", "More like other people putting their business in my nose.", "Another satisfied client's wife.", "Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.", "Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.", "Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?", "So you married your father's business partner?", "You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.", "Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?", "Over the water department, or over you?", "Then it was over the water department.", "Oh, yeah?", "Never forgave him for what?", "You sure shout that?", "What about you? Do you and your father get along?", "Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.", "That dam is a con job.", "The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.", "Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?", "In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.", "Know him?", "Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.", "It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.", "We got it. We got it, baby.", "There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.", "Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.", "You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.", "They may not know it but they are.", "Get in the car.", "Maid's night off?", "What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.", "Easy, it's an innocent question.", "I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.", "What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?", "Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.", "Why?", "It was in Chinatown.", "Working for the District Attorney.", "As little as possible.", "They do in Chinatown.", "Yeah.", "Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...", "You can't always tell what's going on there.", "I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.", "Your eye.", "There's something black in the green part of your eye.", "...A flaw...", "Where?", "And I want to know where.", "Where are you going?", "The Albacore Club.", "I know.", "I saw him.", "This morning.", "There hasn't been a lot of time.", "That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.", "Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.", "Give me an example.", "That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?", "Including the death of your husband?", "Okay, give me the keys.", "It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.", "C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!", "You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.", "Then let's go talk to her.", "What about?", "You mean she just found out?", "That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.", "Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.", "Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.", "I will if you don't.", "Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?", "I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.", "Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.", "Sure.", "Where's the girl?", "I want to see her.", "Going somewhere?", "J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar", "You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.", "You know any good criminal lawyers?", "Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.", "I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?", "Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...", "There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.", "Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?", "Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.", "That's good. Now what's her name?", "Katherine?... Katherine who?", "I said the truth!", "I said I want the truth.", "To Mexico...", "...so that's why you hate him...", "Yeah... where are you taking her now?", "You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.", "That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.", "I'll take care of it.", "...where does Kyo live?", "On his day off. Get the exact address.", "How do you know?", "Let me handle that.", "Sure, but I'd like to handle it.", "Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.", "Sophie.", "Sophie.", "Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me \u2013 so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.", "Where'd he go yesterday?", "Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.", "Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.", "Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?", "Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.", "Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?", "When did you come in?", "Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?", "I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.", "...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?", "The obituary column?", "'Those people?' Miss Sessions.", "Yeah, Sophie.", "Who?", "Don't know her. Take a number.", "Okay.", "Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.", "Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.", "There's just one question.", "Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?", "Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?", "That's exactly what we wanted to hear.", "I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?", "Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?", "We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.", "J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.", "And Mulwray isn't?", "Maybe he takes it very seriously.", "You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?", "Well, tell him I'll be back.", "Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.", "I cut myself shaving.", "Only when I breathe.", "I never was.", "Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.", "Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.", "Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.", "Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?", "That's like saying they're in Arizona.", "You're a married man, am I right?", "Hard working, have a wife and kids...", "I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.", "Yes?", "Well... I think I... I would've remembered.", "Well, no.", "Never.", "Speak English?... Habla Ingles?", "Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...", "What about the water?", "When it comes? What'd you tell him?", "Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.", "Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.", "So how are you, Morty?", "Come again?", "The L.A. River?", "It's bone dry, Morty.", "Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.", "Yeah.", "Who?", "Yeah?... I do?", "Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.", "How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?", "Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?", "No, really?", "I am sorry.", "I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.", "Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?", "Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?", "Then go home and forget about it.", "I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.", "All right, what's your husband's first name?", "Water and Power?", "Yeah.  Do you have any references?", "That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?", "Yeah.", "Yeah, I'll do that.", "Mr. Mulwray, please.", "Gittes.", "It's personal. Has he been out long?", "Gee whiz.  And I'm late.", "Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?", "Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.", "I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.", "Julian Cross worked for the water department?", "He did or he didn't?", "He owned the water department?", "He owned the entire water supply for the city?", "How did they get it away from him?", "Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.", "They were partners.", "This?", "What about?", "Apple core?", "Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?", "Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.", "All she needed for that was the phone book!", "When I find out who that phony bitch was.", "They're all a bunch of phonies.", "I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.", "Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.", "Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.", "Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.", "What's that, pal?", "Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?", "Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?", "Neither do I.", "I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross.

He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?", "Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?

He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -", "Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.

You caught on, didn't you?", "I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.

No, thank you.", "Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?", "Are you running this Board or am I?", "The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.", "No lawyers, Drew.

She knew stuff like that.", "Why didn't you stop me?", "I thought you'd heard a trillion times --", "Dinner?  Absolutely.", "I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind.

Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?", "Okay.  Goodnight.", "That's okay.", "Just a manner of speaking.", "What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.

I'm going to take a nap.", "Then I can't help you.", "I couldn't sleep.", "Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.", "I'm her father!", "Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.", "Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --", "You're violating the laws of the universe.", "Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.", "And I don't give a shit.", "Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.", "Yes?", "What are you saying, that it's time to go?", "Yeah.", "Thanks.", "What the hell do you care?", "You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.", "Say again?", "You're what?", "You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?", "Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.", "How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --", "Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.", "Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.", "Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.", "Well, they're mine now.", "With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?", "Does she know where she's going?", "I don't expect you to.", "I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.", "Get him in here.", "Joe, don't do this --", "It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --", "I told you to shut up.", "He is --", "-- An IRS man.", "The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.", "Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --", "An offense --", "Thank you.", "I guess you have your reasons.", "That's life.  What can I tell you?", "Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?", "You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?", "Death!", "You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.", "You want me to be your guide --?", "I do?  How long will you be staying?", "And then --?", "Excuse me?  Could I say something?", "It just occurred to me --", "When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.", "What?", "'Yes' what?", "I didn't ask any question.", "I don't!", "I'm sorry, I --", "Where are you?  Are you there?", "Please.  Talk to me --", "What do you mean?!", "Know what?  Know what, goddammit!", "What the hell is this?  Who are you?", "About what?", "'Take me'...?  Where?", "'The one' to do what?", "Get what?", "What the hell are you talking about?", "I'm sorry --", "Yes what?", "What question?", "The 'question' --", "Good morning, Quince.", "I'm doing great.  You ready?", "How's that, Quince?", "Thank you, Quince.", "Next week?", "No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?", "Yeah, I give a shit.", "It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.", "Sure.", "Yes, I believe I do.", "All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.", "Quince, I've got confidence in you.", "Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?", "Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings\" shit.", "Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.", "Eddie?", "Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?", "Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --", "If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.", "Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.", "I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.", "Hi, honey.", "Drew's aboard?", "How did you know?", "Does Drew tell you everything?", "You like him, don't you?", "I don't like to interfere.", "Not my birthday again?", "Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.", "I am.  With you.", "I know it's none of my business --", "Do you love Drew?", "Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?", "Don't get carried away.", "Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --", "Well, I wasn't going to say that --", "Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.", "That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.", "Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.", "Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.", "Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.", "I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.", "Aw, you're tough.", "Stay open.

Joe, let's go.", "Will it?...", "That was wonderful.", "Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?", "What is the nature of your interest in Joe?", "I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --", "I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --", "Nothing.", "Then what is it?", "Joe?", "I don't know.", "I don't understand.", "This is crazy --", "You don't know anything about Joe --", "Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.", "I don't know, I can't say --", "In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.", "I don't care if you love him!

It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?", "No. I went riding rather early.", "No, Just riding bareback, that's all.

Why would they have a falling out over me?", "Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.

We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!", "They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me.

You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through.

I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?", "You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?", "I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?", "I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that.

I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?", "I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.", "Yeah? Oh, great!", "I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --", "You should stay.", "Okay.", "I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.", "You'll call me, right?", "When?", "Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.", "You didn't say anything about my hair.", "Yo ho ho!", "...a little.

Faggot.", "How can you watch this crap?", "I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.", "I want to have a baby.", "No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.", "You're not ready.", "What?!", "Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!", "You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!", "I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!", "It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!", "Would you get me another, Joely?", "You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --", "You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.", "I want to know you.", "Joel, you're a liar.", "More?", "Joely...", "Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?", "It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, \"It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.

Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?", "What if you hide me?", "Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.", "I'm right here.", "Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.", "You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.", "You remember what happened next?", "-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?", "What?", "Really? Is he cute?", "Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.", "But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.", "Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.", "Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?", "Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?", "Joel!", "Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!", "I love it!", "Yeah.", "This is our first \"date\" date.", "Naomi, I guess.", "What was I wearing?", "Egad, were you horrified?", "I'll buy that. Black's always good.", "I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.", "But you weren't. I could tell.", "So what. Infatuation is good, too.", "Come up and see me... now.", "Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.", "Is that what you want?", "I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.", "Yeah?", "Well, you're married.", "Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.", "So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.", "Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.", "I had you pegged, didn't I?", "Probably.", "I know.", "Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.", "Hi there.", "I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.", "I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser.

I'm fishing.", "I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?", "Oh God, how horrid.", "Yeah, like that.", "This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.", "What do we do?", "No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.", "But my sleeping is really fucked up.", "You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.", "I'll give you a couple.

There's this poem --", "I think, before.", "Yeah, maybe.", "Do you know her poem that starts \"Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...", "Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.", "I wish we did.

Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.", "I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.", "I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.", "Yeah.

You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.", "Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...", "Sailor!", "I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.", "...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.", "You still got plenty energy for me, baby.", "Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?", "What'd you say to her?", "Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!", "You mean like pedal pushers?", "You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?", "Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?", "I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.", "I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?", "What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.", "We got through two states already.", "It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?", "Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.", "Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.", "Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?", "What kinda trash talk is that?", "That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?", "Got anyplace special in mind?", "How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.", "I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.", "What's that, honey?", "It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.", "M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.", "Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?", "Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?", "I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.", "Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?", "Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!", "Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.", "We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?", "I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.", "It's just another case, Sailor.", "One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.", "Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?", "Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.", "Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?", "You certain?", "Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?", "I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.", "I really do think it's the best night of my life.", "Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.", "You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?", "What was this one?", "Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.", "Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.", "Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.", "Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...", "Who do?", "Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!", "Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.", "You think he saw us?", "He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?", "Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.", "I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!", "Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?", "I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?", "Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.", "We'll find out in a hurry.", "I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?", "You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?", "Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?", "You think she's pretty?", "Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.", "I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.", "Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?", "It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.", "Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?", "How much we got left, honey?", "You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?", "You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.", "I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!", "The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.", "Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?", "I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...", "You're scarin' me, baby.", "You knew my daddy?", "Oh shit...", "God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.", "That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.", "How'd you know my daddy?", "Yeah, I'm here.", "No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...", "That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos... ...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.", "My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.", "I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.", "Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?", "If you say so.", "I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.", "What's that?", "Oh God, Sailor.", "SAILOR!!!", "Sailor, what are we gonna do?", "You think she's gonna make it?", "I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...", "She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?", "Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.", "No radio or TV...", "And no AC.", "Now what?", "Sailor?", "This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.", "I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.", "That you, Sail, honey?", "You find any work?", "I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.", "A little, I think... Darlin'?", "Come sit by me.", "Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.", "No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.", "Sailor? You know what?", "Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.", "Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.", "Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.", "I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.", "You been drinkin', huh?", "Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?", "Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.", "Yeah... He was lookin' for you.", "Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.", "So where'd you say you was?", "Sail?", "Let's leave here.", "I mean tomorrow.", "Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.", "Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?", "He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.", "That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.", "He's the kind liked it.", "Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?", "Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.", "That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.", "Shake hands with your daddy.", "You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.", "I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.", "Really, Sail, I'll be okay.", "What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.", "How can you say that, Sailor?", "SAILOR!!!!", "I'll bet.", "Damn!", "HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!", "Mama???", "Like hell.", "I'm fine, mama.

You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.", "You'll be fighting with the octopus.", "This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.", "Once you're in it, it warms up.", "Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.", "Huh?", "Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.", "Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!", "Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.", "No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.", "I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.", "I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.", "Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?", "Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?", "What are you doing?", "Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?", "Don't you have any savings?", "Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.", "Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?", "Don't worry.", "Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.", "What happened?!", "Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.", "I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.", "No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...", "Soon, Bela... Soon.", "No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.", "Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.", "That's great.  Let's do a take.", "And, cut...", "Perfect.", "Has anyone ever been to Downey?", "Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?", "Yeah, she's really somethin'.", "I just wish you coulda seen the movie.", "I don't know.  Where?", "I dunno.  Lie on the beach?", "I've never seen anything like him!", "Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?", "This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!", "If you say so.", "And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!", "What's to protect?  It was perfect!", "Um, okay... roll camera", "Sound!", "What do you mean?", "No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.", "This is the big moment...!", "Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.", "What do you think you're doin'?!", "You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.", "You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!", "NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!", "Wow.", "Edward Wood, Sir.", "H-how'd you know?!", "Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?", "I don't understand.", "It's that easy?", "Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.", "I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.", "Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.", "Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?", "Will he be okay?", "Isn't he?", "Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.

I've got the most incredible news!", "Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!", "Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!", "No!  A horror movie star!", "Close!  The <u>other</u> one!", "Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!", "No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.", "It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.", "Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...", "Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.", "This is my way of telling you --", "Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.", "It's a damn good role.", "It takes me comfortable.", "Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.", "Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.", "Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.", "From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.", "Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.", "But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!", "Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?", "Exactly.", "I'm no good.", "Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.", "Tell him \"Bride\" is in pre- production.", "That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!", "Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made \"Glen Or Glenda.\"  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.", "It was the only way I could get the movie made!", "I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?", "But there's plenty of other parts.", "The secretary.  Or the file clerk.", "Goddamn landlord.", "Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.", "Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.", "<u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!", "So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.", "Does she have room for me?", "Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.", "That's right...", "That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.", "None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.", "Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.", "Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.", "Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.", "Dolores, wait!", "Did you really mean those things you said..?", "But you used to say --", "I understand you just moved here?", "So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.", "For this one, we need $60,000.", "Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.", "Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!", "I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?", "Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.", "Yeah.  Exactly!", "I kinda need it now.", "Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.", "The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.", "Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.", "No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  \"Dracula\"!  \"The Raven\"! \"The Black Cat\"!", "That's not true --", "Well, uh, if I could I would...", "It's Wood.  Ed Wood.", "Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.", "I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.", "Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.", "Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: \"The Vampire's Tomb,\" \"The Ghoul Goes West\"... and \"Doctor Acula\"!", "<u>Dr. Acula</u>!", "But Bela Lugosi's in it!", "Hruphh...?", "Yeah...?", "I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.", "You could say that --", "Raising money is tough.", "Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.", "Absolutely!  You see this script..?", "\"Graverobbers From Outer Space\"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.", "From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.", "It's a guaranteed blockbuster!", "Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!", "Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!", "It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as \"Bela Lugosi's Final Film\"", "Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.", "And PERFECT.  CUT!", "I like to think so.", "People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.", "Mr. Reynolds!", "We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!", "Oh, of course!", "So, Mr. Johnson --", "Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?", "I think you're quite handsome.", "Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.", "Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.", "So anyway, I've got this new script, \"Bride Of The Atom,\" and there's a part you're ideal for: \"Lobo.\"  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.", "Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.", "Really?  Was the third act too intense?", "But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.", "Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.", "But I thought me and Dolores had something.", "Don't worry.  We're almost there.", "We're escaping!", "Excuse me, Sir...?", "Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.", "Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?", "I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!", "Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --", "And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!", "Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.", "So you're not gonna make the movie?", "Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.", "Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.", "No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.", "Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.", "Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.", "Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.", "Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??", "No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!", "Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!", "No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!", "Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!", "No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.", "Uh, yeah.  Our picture.", "Because he's <u>my friend</u>.", "There's still a sex-change --", "I don't think he's a schmuck.", "So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.", "Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.", "I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.", "Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?", "Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.", "Um, I guess --", "Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.", "Why not??", "Maybe it needs special handling.", "You can't talk that way about my movie.", "Hello.", "I got married last night.", "The marriage already ended.", "What are you making?", "How long's he been here?", "Oh, hi.", "I am.  How's your father?", "Not good...", "I just picked them up on the way over...", "No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...", "Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...", "Yeah!  Don't forget \"Mercury Theatre\"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.", "What do you mean?", "I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.", "Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.", "I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.", "No! I love sex with girls.", "Okay?", "Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?", "Bela died.", "I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...", "I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...", "I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...", "You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!", "The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?", "No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?", "No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??", "Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.", "Those assholes.", "Yeah...  I should give her a call.", "Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.", "Who's Dr. Tom?", "I can't get it to go up.", "C'mon!  Let's just go.", "Let's get married.", "<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!", "So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.", "Excuse me, Miss Vampira?", "You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!", "No.  I think my film is perfect for you.", "No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?", "Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...", "No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, \"Bride Of The Monster.\"", "It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!", "I'm really sorry...", "I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the \"Ghoul's Wife.\"", "You don't wanna be noticed?", "<u>It's uncanny</u>.", "LOOK AT HIS SKULL!", "Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last \"Francis the Mule\" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.", "So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.", "The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?", "Well it looks good.  Let's use it!", "Yeah...?", "Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?", "Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?", "Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!", "Yes!", "YES!  JUST DO IT!", "Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?", "You know, to make the legs move --", "Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.", "Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.", "That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.", "I do.", "Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!", "No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!", "Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!", "NOOOOO!!!", "I'm directing.", "And you're gonna make a bundle.

Come on!", "Who are you talking to Jack?", "Bingo!", "Are there any questions?", "Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, \"You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men\"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, \"What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?\"...And the King says, \"I need a sip of water to cool my throat\"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, \"How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find\"? And the fool answers, \"I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty.\"... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.", "I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.", "Maybe, when we get the Grail...", "Happily married, probably.", "Is that what your girlfriend does for you?", "I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.

All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.", "I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.", "I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.", "If I'm wrong...", "Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?", "What was it, so I'll know.", "Where's my brother?", "I asked about Fredo?", "I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.", "They can come in now.", "Alright.", "Was it a boy or a girl?", "What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!", "And Kay...she's all right?", "Does she blame it on me?  The baby?", "Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.", "They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.", "He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.", "I want it met.", "I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...", "I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?", "They are everywhere!", "I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.", "Good.  Then you're staying.", "This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.", "Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.", "How's the baby?", "Does it feel like a boy?", "I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.", "Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.", "I had no idea...", "Where?", "Why don't you sit down?", "There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.", "Why too late?", "His brother came to help him.", "On a plane back to Sicily.", "That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.", "Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.", "When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.", "Kay, I told you...", "I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.", "No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!", "If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.", "We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.", "How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.", "I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.", "It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?", "There are still things I have to do.", "Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?", "No, I meant lose his family.", "But times are different...", "Not for a few years.", "Yes.", "The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.", "You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.", "The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.", "Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.", "Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?", "Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.", "It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;", "I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.", "We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.", "The money was sent.", "I wouldn't consider anyone else.", "You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.", "This doubles my investment.", "Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.", "I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?", "Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?", "I know that; but who gave the go ahead.", "No, I'm fine.", "Very impressive.", "It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.", "So, that occurred to me.", "How is his health?", "Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?", "He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.", "Let him gamble.", "Yes.", "No.", "I deny his every charge.", "That is a complete falsehood.", "That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.", "I do not.", "I do not.", "I know.", "After dinner.", "We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.", "You were unfair with them.", "Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.", "They feel cheated.", "Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!", "Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.", "I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.", "No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.", "Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.", "I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?", "In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.", "I want you to help me take my revenge.", "I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.", "I want you to settle on their terms.", "Trust me; do as I ask.", "Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?", "I know.", "Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.", "This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.", "Good.", "My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.", "I trust these men with my life.

I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.", "She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.", "You're not tired of it?", "So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?", "Shit.", "Sure.", "Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. \"Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?\" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.", "I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.", "Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.", "That's him. How do you know 'em?", "Ordell pick up his bond?", "The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.", "I didn't?", "Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.", "It was the other guy who busted me.", "I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.", "I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.", "With ten thousand? Nine.", "It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?", "That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.", "Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.", "Yeah, if I cooperate.", "But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.", "I think maybe I have more options than I thought.", "I am. Have a seat.", "I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.", "Thanks, but I have my own now.", "What, I couldn't hear you?", "Yeah.", "Want to hear some music?", "I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.", "I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.", "Uh-huh.", "The Delfonics.", "'74, I think.", "I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.", "I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.", "I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.", "It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.", "He told me last night.", "He came by.", "We talked.", "He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.", "He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?", "Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.", "If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.", "I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.", "How do you feel about getting old?", "I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?", "Really?", "How'd you feel about it?", "It's different with men.", "My ass ain't the same.", "Yeah.", "I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?", "Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.", "Surprise.", "I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?", "What'd ya see?", "How was it?", "Oh, are you? Does she know that?", "Does it happen to all men?", "And Annette's it for you?", "Who was your girl before Annette?", "Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in \"Speed.\" She's cute.", "Why?", "How old's Annette?", "I go back to work tomorrow.", "They seem to like the idea.", "Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.", "He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.", "Right around here, in the food court.", "I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.", "Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.", "I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.", "Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.", "He's setting me up to make a proposition.", "You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.", "Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.", "He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.", "He tries to act cool.", "What about you Max?", "No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.", "You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.", "You're avoiding the question.", "Why?", "When did you decide?", "The day you got me out of jail?", "Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?", "What do you do when he comes home?", "You do that?", "Did you do it that night?", "And is that it?", "I'm not sure you answered my question.", "If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?", "What if I've figured a way?", "It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.", "That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.", "I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.", "Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.", "All he needed was a reasonable explanation.", "Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.", "Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.", "In the bag underneath.", "He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.", "Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.", "Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.", "That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.", "Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.", "How'd you find out?", "How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?", "He's liable to shoot you.", "Ray wants him.", "That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?", "It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.", "Get Ordell to come to your office.", "Uh-huh.", "Tell him I want to give him his money.", "I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.", "Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.", "He's already there.", "Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?", "I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.", "Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.", "Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.", "You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.", "I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.", "He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is \"woefully and wantonly\" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.", "I told him I might.", "They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?", "I didn't use you, Max.", "I never lied to you.", "We're partners.", "Do you blame yourself for helping me?", "I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.", "Spain.", "Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?", "Wanna go?", "Sure I can't twist your arm?", "I thought you were tired of your business?", "Are you scared of me?", "You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.", "Who's side are you on?", "What if I plead guilty?", "If I don't cooperate?", "Do you live together?", "Not every day?", "Then you don't see him for a few days?", "You know what's in the bag you're taking?", "Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.", "Yeah?", "What the fuck is that shit?", "You planted that shit on me.", "Can I smoke?", "I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.", "I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.", "If I'm working, I can help you.", "You never asked me if I did or not.", "He sells guns.", "No.", "He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?", "Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.", "What are you doing?", "I thought you were going to let this one through.", "A Broadway shopping bag.", "Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.", "This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.", "Not really.", "What for?", "I imagine shit needs to be done.", "Not yet.", "White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.", "It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.", "I'm sure that was the idea.", "I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.", "Uh-huh.", "She didn't say.", "Uh-huh.", "Right. Everything's the same, except one change...", "You said that the last time.", "We could, if I'm not in jail.", "I was told ten thousand in each pack.", "I never have. It's not my money.", "Ever been tempted?", "Uh-huh.", "Yes. All those things are true.", "That would be one point of view.", "How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?", "Si.", "I thought I did.", "I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.", "Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.", "She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.", "I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.", "I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.", "Not in the fitting room.", "I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?", "I have no idea.", "If it'll make you happy.", "I thought you were watching him.", "So what happens now?", "What about me?", "Do you think I took some of that money?", "Oh, hi.", "I'm waiting for the phone.", "Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.", "Killian's.", "Uh-uh.", "How long you been with Ordell?", "What were you two fighting about?", "That coke was yours, wasn't it?", "Beaumont Livingston?", "Kinda.", "Dreaming.", "Keep it between us girls?", "I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.", "Hi, Melanie.", "Yeah, do you like it?", "Do you got something for me?", "I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?", "Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.", "I was expecting you. Come in.", "I got some vodka in the freezer.", "Yeah.", "Sure.", "For what?", "The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.", "They asked.", "I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.", "Beaumont Livingston.", "And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.", "I didn't tell 'em anything.", "They told me.", "What do you think it is?", "You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.", "Shut your ass up and grab the wall!", "The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.", "Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?", "I said, you understand what I'm saying", "Go sit over in that chair.", "Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.", "Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?", "Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.", "It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.", "One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.", "All your money's in Mexico.", "I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.", "I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.", "The Cockatoo Inn.", "It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...", "It's a cockatoo.", "I do okay.", "I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.", "I told them.", "They already know it's you.", "Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.", "I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.", "It's true, isn't it?", "They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.", "...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.", "You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.", "If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.", "I don't know. One of your friends.", "If you want.", "The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...", "No, I give it to someone else first.", "That's the idea.", "Can you cover that?", "I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.", "Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.", "I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.", "That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.", "Plus the same deal as before.", "The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?", "Who?", "Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.", "I need to talk to you alone.", "I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.", "Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.", "I was there, I saw her do it.", "I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.", "Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.", "Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.", "It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.", "Are you sure she don't know about the money?", "What does she think she's gettin?", "Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?", "Designer clothes.", "The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.", "Where you gonna be during all this?", "Ray, the A.T.F. guy.", "If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.", "And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.", "Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.", "He won't know where the money came from.

Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?", "That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles.

For cryin' out loud!", "No, it's not Don.", "I didn't mean to hurt you.", "You what?", "There's no disease, I can tell you.", "I'm glad you do.", "Dorothy. No!", "You called me Jeffrey.", "Yes.", "No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.", "I guess I should go.", "I think I better go.", "I'll call you.", "What?", "You look beautiful to me.", "Oh no.", "Yeah, it's me.", "It's okay. It's okay.", "Who, Dorothy?", "Don? Where is he?", "I promise, Dorothy. I promise.", "He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.", "Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?", "Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?", "No thanks.", "I don't want to go.", "On a ride.", "Here's to Ben.", "What?", "Nothing.", "Yes.", "For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.", "Mom.", "This is it.", "Be right down.", "What time are visiting hours?", "Well. Okay.", "Yeah?", "What?", "Thanks a lot, Mom.", "I'm going out for awhile.", "No, I'm just gonna walk around.", "God, you scared me.", "Nothing. I'm fine.", "Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?", "I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.", "Alright.", "Yeah, I know.", "No. No thank you.", "Yeah. okay.", "Yeah.", "Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.", "Say \"goodnight\" to Sandy.", "That sounds great!", "Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?", "No.", "Well.", "No, you're right.", "Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.", "Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.", "Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.", "Are you feeling okay?", "It's good to see you, Dad.", "How ya doin' Dad?", "Good deal Dad.", "Yeah, how did you know?", "Oh yeah?", "Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.", "No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?", "How is Central these days?", "What else is new? Right?", "I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.", "What do you know about the ear? Anything?", "Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?", "Do you know who was brought in for questioning?", "Were all these people questioned this afternoon?", "The ear is from a missing person maybe?", "It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?", "I guess you have to get back home soon?", "Where are they?", "Did they find out anything when they questioned her?", "Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?", "You really do hear a lot, don't you?", "I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.", "It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.", "I don't know. He moved away.", "Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.", "I guess I'll see you sometime.", "Yeah. Good bye.", "You hungry or thirsty, or both?", "I'd like to talk to you about something.", "I don't want to cause any trouble.", "I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.", "There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.", "Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?", "Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.", "Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.", "You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few \"Awake\" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?", "Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.", "Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?", "Let's go.", "Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?", "Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.", "Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?", "Yes and no. Did you recognize him?", "I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?", "Yeah.", "Pretty clever. Are you game for more?", "You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?", "Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.", "I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.", "First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.", "Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?", "Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.", "First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.", "Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.", "Two.", "Here's to. An interesting experience.", "Why not?", "It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?", "Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?", "Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.", "I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.", "Oh, okay, can I call?", "Look, it can wait till Sunday.", "Yeah.", "Are you sure?", "Okay, thanks.", "That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?", "Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.", "Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?", "What's with Mike?", "I'm sorry, I didn't...", "No way. I'm about to blow up.", "OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the \"yellow man\". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.", "I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.", "Actually. I've been in twice.", "Yes.", "Yeah. I mean a little, you know.", "That doesn't bother you, does it?", "That's what I thought.", "Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?", "Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.", "I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.", "I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?", "Okay, Sandy.", "Can I give you a kiss good night?", "Okay, okay.", "See ya tomorrow.", "I'm really sorry.", "You want to go talk to him?", "That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?", "Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?", "Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.", "Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.", "Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.", "Yeah.", "I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.", "Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.", "You worry about me really?", "Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.", "Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.", "Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?", "No.", "Okay. Great!", "Okay.", "Just some fatherly advice.", "Nothing, really! It's good to see you.", "Where to?", "I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.", "You look beautiful.", "I like that idea, that's a real good idea.", "I can't dance fast.", "Really. You want to dance with someone else?", "Let's wait for some slow one.", "You want to dance?", "Frank!!!", "My father has a gun at home.", "Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.", "Dorothy!... Dorothy!", "Yes.", "No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?", "Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.", "Shhh. I'll tell you.", "I should go with her, Sandy.", "Sandy?", "Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.", "Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.", "Yeah.

I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.", "How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?", "You should watch that!", "Hardly.", "Freddie, do you have something to say?", "I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.", "Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.", "I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...", "Mr Greenleaf.", "I'm well, thank you.", "Yes it is.", "Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?", "I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.", "I think it might hurt her to know.", "I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.", "Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?", "You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.", "We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --", "Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.", "There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.", "Thanks, yes, I think we did.", "I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?", "Okay.", "I hope she never knows.", "Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.", "You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.", "Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.", "Bird. That's jazz.", "He's not a man, he's a god.", "I absolutely agree with Marge.", "That ring's so great. The green one.", "It's superb.", "I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?", "My fianc\u00e9e.", "I'm fine.", "Sure.", "So I'm learning.", "What about Cortina?", "I'll go and see what's the matter.", "Hello Marge.", "How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?", "I was just looking at you --  so quiet.", "I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.", "I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.", "Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.", "He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.", "Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.", "Search me. I guess we're abandoned.", "I think you're right.", "Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?", "No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.", "Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.", "I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --", "Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!", "Marge, when did you get here?", "I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.", "Dickie did it.", "My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?", "Get on. I'll take you to him.", "We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --", "No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.", "Hello Marge!", "I was looking forward to seeing him.", "That's a terrific idea.", "Look at me what?", "And you, sir? Any better?", "He's having an early night.", "Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.", "What?", "I can explain.", "Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.", "Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.", "Shut up! Shut up!", "Marge? Where are you going?", "The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.", "Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.", "I told you. He gave them to me.", "I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.", "It's all true.", "But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.", "I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --", "What?", "Oh Marge.", "Excuse me?", "Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.", "Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.", "My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.", "Emily.  Just kidding.", "As in the...?", "Randall.", "What?", "How did you know that?", "Is Freddie in Rome?", "I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.", "Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.", "I know.", "I'll take them both.", "Let's go.", "Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.", "You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...", "Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.", "Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.", "Exactly. 10.30 --", "Hello Meredith.", "Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.", "Just kidding. Are you alone?", "Of course. Aunt Joan.", "I've thought about you.", "I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.", "They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.", "I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?", "You know what -- I am.", "Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone.", "I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.", "Thanks.", "I can't later.", "Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?", "Ten thirty?", "Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.", "Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?", "Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...", "My God.", "It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.", "Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.", "What rumour?", "It's okay.", "What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?", "No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --", "It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.", "No.", "Tell him I have a fianc\u00e9e, Dickie has a fianc\u00e9e and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.", "No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!", "Just because he doesn't like Americans!", "Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.", "Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.", "Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...", "I'll fix some drinks.", "I'm fine.", "It's okay.", "You try. You try talking to her.", "I give up.", "Ask me what I want to change about this moment.", "Nothing.", "All kinds of things. Making plans.", "I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.", "Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.", "Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.", "Was who Meredith?", "Hardly kissing. Kissing off.", "I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.", "Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?", "Well that would be even better gossip.", "I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.", "I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.", "Peter, I... I...", "You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.", "You're such a liar...", "Yes?", "I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.", "I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?", "Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.", "Postmortem?", "Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.", "Can we go up? Do you mind?", "My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.", "The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?", "I really don't want to see anybody.", "Even her.", "What about Ripley?", "Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.", "Was it? Did you speak to Tom?", "I don't remember the exact date.", "A few days ago.", "No!", "It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.", "31 people.", "Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.", "Thank you.", "I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.", "I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.", "It is a little coarse, yes.", "I have!", "No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her!

Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?", "Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...", "I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...", "I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...", "Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?", "Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.", "Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...", "San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.", "The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...", "Well - if I'm not in the way...", "I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-", "I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.", "I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...", "During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...", "You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...", "The curtains. I made them myself.", "While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-", "No trouble at all.", "Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?", "I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?", "Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?", "I've got it.", "Right here.", "That's my job.  See you at tea time...", "Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-", "Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...", "Mr. Sampson's birthday.

You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!", "Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.", "And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?", "God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!", "You whore!", "How long do I have?", "Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.", "Lacerda?", "I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!", "But what about our room? And the golf shoes?", "No, no. Don't leave me!", "Not yet. I want to study its habits.", "What are you talking about?", "That's good...", "They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.", "Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!", "Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?", "Why?", "Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.", "Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!", "This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.", "Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling. Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?", "Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.", "Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.", "Not much. Why?", "GO?", "Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.", "OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.", "That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.", "OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.", "It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.", "Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.", "Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.", "Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.", "What for?", "No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.", "He told me he was turning in early...", "That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?", "Where'd you get that knife?", "What limes?", "Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.", "You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.", "What tape?", "You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.", "OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.", "How about a check?", "Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!", "Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!", "Jesus.", "Are you ready?", "Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...", "Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!", "There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!", "You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!", "What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!", "You degenerate pig!", "WELL? What are your plans?", "Lucy.", "Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.", "She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.", "It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.", "I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.", "In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.", "You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.", "The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.", "What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?", "Us?", "I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.", "That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.", "Maybe we should take it easy tonight.", "They're actually nice people when you get to know them.", "Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.", "Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.", "Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!", "Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!", "What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.", "Like big lizards.", "They were all veterans.", "What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.", "We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.", "They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.", "Lucy is looking for you.", "Me?", "It's gone too far.", "What is this?", "Adrenochrome...", "I remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid.\"", "I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again. Where'd you get this?", "Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!", "I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...", "Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.", "Extract of pineal!", "Right!", "Yes!", "FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?", "So do we, lady.", "Do you think you can handle it?", "Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.", "Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!", "There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...", "I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.", "Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.", "We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.", "Never missed a plane yet.", "Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?", "Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.", "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!", "You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?", "Of course, officer.", "Why not?

What's he want?", "Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.", "Can I help you?", "Great!  How's it going?", "Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.", "I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.", "You could say that.", "I'm not at liberty to say.", "In a storage facility.", "Yes, it would.", "No, you may not.", "Because you didn't say the magic word.", "The magic word is \"please.\"", "Why do you want to see it?", "Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.", "Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!", "Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...", "... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.", "All right.  What is it?", "Good guess -- but no.", "Close -- but definitely wrong.", "Nervous?", "Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?", "Sorry.  This isn't your day.", "You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?", "I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.", "Then my theory was correct.", "What have you got, Egon?", "Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?", "Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?", "Wow!", "Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.", "Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.", "Yeah, I can smell it.", "What?", "Why not?", "What do you mean \"bad?\"", "It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.", "I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.", "I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?", "Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.", "You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.", "I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.", "If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.", "Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.", "She said he was \"the Destructor.\"", "Gozer.", "Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.", "No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!", "But it's my favorite state.", "Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?", "Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.", "Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?", "Looked at with your eyes.", "Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.", "It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.", "What do we do now?", "What do I say?", "Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.", "\"Get her?\"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?", "Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.", "If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.", "Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.", "Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.", "You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.", "Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.", "To go into business for ourselves.", "You'll never regret this, Ray.", "You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.", "Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.", "This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of \"pricey\" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.", "Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?", "Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?", "It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.", "Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.", "So do I.", "Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.", "So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.", "Ray -- Something's here.", "Third floor.  Get down here,", "Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.", "It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.", "How do you know?", "I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.", "I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?", "Who was the architect?", "Well, that ought to do it.", "What?

What happens if you crack the neck?", "Yeah.", "When was this, like '96?", "Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.", "Your guitar is named Kimber?", "That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.", "I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?", "Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.", "Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?", "Why aren't you at work?", "No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?", "Like what?", "Oh.", "Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!", "You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?", "Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.", "I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.", "No, he's the dad.", "The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.", "That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.", "You know... it's parts...", "Yeah?", "Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.", "What is it?", "I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.", "Hey, I like this.", "You don't have to do that.", "I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.", "The Wizard of Gore?", "Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.", "Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.", "This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.", "So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?", "Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?", "My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.", "Uh, thanks.", "I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.", "Why? What the big deal?", "I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.", "I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.", "Hey, what kind of swag did you score?", "Why?", "You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.", "So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.", "I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.", "Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.", "Consider it your musical education.", "Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.", "Is Vanessa here?", "Cool.", "Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!", "Oh God, you're one of those guys...", "\"Most Fruitful Yuki\"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!", "Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.", "What?", "You do?", "That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?", "Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!", "Oh, okay. Like this.", "Only squares and nerds go to dances.", "I don't know.", "What?", "No.", "No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!", "This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!", "I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!", "But you're old!", "I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.", "Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?", "Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.", "Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.", "Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!", "Uh, hi Su-Chin.", "Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?", "You should try Adderall.", "Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, \"Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!\"", "Well, it was nice seeing you.", "Really? Fingernails?", "Vanessa, right?", "Sure.", "A Maker's Mark, please. Up.", "Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.", "Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.", "Well, you're lucky it's not you.", "Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.", "Room with a toilet, got it.", "I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.", "Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?", "Nothing...", "I went to the doctor today.", "Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...", "This is the baby. Your baby.", "Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying \"Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?\"", "I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.", "What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?", "Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.", "Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.", "Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!", "Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.", "Elbow.", "Nothing.", "I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.", "Hi. I'm here for the big show?", "Juno MacGuff.", "No thank you. I'm off sex.", "Congrats.", "My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...", "Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?", "No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.", "They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.", "I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!", "The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.", "No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.", "Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.", "Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!", "I have no idea what kind of girl I am.", "I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.", "Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.", "Hi Dad.", "Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?", "Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.", "Yeah, she does.", "I'm losing my faith in humanity.", "I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.", "Yeah, like people in love.", "Dad, no!", "Please stop now.", "Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.", "Either I just pissed my pants or...", "Thundercats are go!", "I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.", "Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.", "Jesus, I didn't say it was.", "I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.", "I am a suicide risk.", "No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?", "Dude, I'm pregnant.", "It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.", "I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.", "Unfortunately, yes.", "That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.", "I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.", "Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.", "That is sick, man.", "Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.", "Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.", "It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.", "It was magnificent, man!", "I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!", "I'm staying pregnant, Le.", "What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.", "I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.", "Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.", "There are ads? For parents?", "Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.", "There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.", "No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as \"wholesome.\" I'm looking for something a little edgier.", "I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.", "Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!", "I'm pregnant.", "Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!", "It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.", "No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.", "Share the love, Tits!", "You sound shocked or something.", "Right, seriously.", "Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.", "Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.", "Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!", "Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as \"Keith,\" okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.", "Eww, he's all beardy!", "Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.", "Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!", "There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.", "Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me.

I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous.

I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing.

She sings.", "Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?'

Play.", "You can't be serious?", "Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.", "Roger, no.", "Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.", "Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.", "Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.", "Roger?", "Scotty?", "We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.", "Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.", "So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got.

This is great stuff. How ya doin'?", "Why?", "How so?", "But you'll never be whole again.", "Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry.

Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.", "Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch.

It's a funny business, isn't it?", "They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.", "Lose 'em.", "Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.", "Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.", "One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.", "We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.", "Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.", "Two guys?", "No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.", "Three.", "So we got a deal. Four deputies---", "Why don't we make it three deputies and you?", "Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.", "I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.", "Fine.

I don't know all the details.", "But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.", "You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.", "Where the hell did you learn how to deal?", "Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.", "I'll take Columbia for twenty.", "Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.", "How did Nicky collect?", "Eight.", "Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.", "While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.", "But nobody had to take care of Nicky.", "I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.", "Hey.", "Somethin', huh?", "Ginger.", "Honey, come here.", "After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.", "No, of course not.", "Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.", "Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.", "Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.", "And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.", "Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.", "When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'", "...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.", "It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.", "And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.", "I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.", "You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.", "No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?", "He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely... ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.", "Then he called me a faggot. So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.", "If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.", "Okay.", "You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?", "Between...", "You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.", "I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.", "Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.", "I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.", "Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.", "Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.", "Nope, there's no way.", "Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.", "In so many words, yes. It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.", "Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.", "- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.", "Hello.", "It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's... ...very difficult to get in.", "Hey.", "What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.", "I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?", "Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?", "No, I don't wanna come -", "I don't wanna come along with you.", "I'll be honest with you.", "I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...", "...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.", "That's all taken out of context. Okay.", "I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.", "Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.", "Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.", "What happened to me? What happened to you?", "You lost your control.", "Yes, you lost your control.", "All right.", "All right.", "Yeah.", "My wife?", "Now, what does she have to do with all this?", "All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?", "Listen, I would -", "I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.", "Please...", "...don't do it to me...", "Okay?", "Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.", "That's right, yeah.", "Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.", "This guy is gonna run to the FBI.", "I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.", "Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.", "Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.", "The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.", "...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.", "And at the...", "Yeah.", "What - what, Caesar's?", "Why?", "What people?", "I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.", "I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.", "Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.", "I -", "What are you -", "I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.", "Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.", "Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.", "No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...", "...you? Do you remember what I told you?", "You never - ?", "What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!", "Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.", "I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.", "Yeah.", "And what'd she want?", "Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.", "I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.", "She's driving me fuckin' crazy.", "Hello.", "Yeah, uh, who's this?", "Nick?", "No, I'm not okay. How'd you know I was here?", "Well... ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.", "She's there with you?  She's there with you?", "I'll be right there.", "I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.", "Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.", "How do you do?", "Yeah, I heard a lot about you.", "No, that's quite all right.", "I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.", "Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.", "I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.", "I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.", "I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.", "Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.", "No problem.  Sorry.", "Well, that's why they paid so well.", "Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?", "I'll come by.", "Seven o'clock.", "They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.", "And they were usually right.", "...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.", "Next morning bright and early, I get the call.", "Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -", "Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!", "You've got to stop her.", "She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-", "Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.", "Half of everything is mine.", "Half - I'm comin' down.", "Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.", "Why is she eight pounds over?", "I...", "'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.", "She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...", "...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.", "That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.", "No. Just stop everything.", "I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.", "For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...", "We can't get rid of him?", "I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.", "I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.", "Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.", "Why not make them happy?", "Call security.", "I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.", "L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']", "What is it?", "Oh, no.", "No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.", "Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.", "Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.", "Right away. Okay?", "Okay.", "Ginger's mission in life was money.", "See you, Ginger.", "She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.", "Any change?", "That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.", "She took care of the dealers...", "...pit bosses, floor managers.", "But mostly...", "...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.", "The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.", "Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?", "I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.", "I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.", "I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.", "Yeah, I know all that.", "I - I - I...", "No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.", "You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.", "Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?", "You all right?", "Why're you crying?", "Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.", "It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?", "You're with me now.", "Right?", "You sure?", "Want to go? Let's go back in.", "It's chinchilla.", "It's nice isn't it?", "You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?", "The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.", "Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.", "All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.", "Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.", "So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.", "She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.", "But as much as they loved her...", "...they didn't know what really moved her.", "Okay, want to go with Mommy? What do you need?", "Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.", "Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?", "Why do you need that much?", "Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...", "Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.", "Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?", "Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?", "What are you talkin' a- ?", "You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?", "Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.", "You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?", "Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'", "Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?", "Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?", "What?", "Yeah, how do I know?", "What? What?!", "Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -", "It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.", "If not for me, at least for Amy.", "You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.", "Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.", "Yes, I - yes, I do.", "How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.", "You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in... ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...", "I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -", "Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.", "Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?", "Hello.", "Listen...", "...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away... ...please. That's all I'm askin' you.", "What do you mean?", "Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.", "What about the money? Uh, where's the box?", "What's it... ...under?", "How serious?", "It's under... ...twenty-five thousand?", "And... ...the rest of the two million is still there?", "Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.", "All right...", "So, what'd ya do with it?", "With the money.", "Twenty-five thousand for clothes.", "Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.", "Mm-hm.", "The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.", "Yeah.", "But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?", "At the most, which is impossible for him.", "Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?", "I'm just tryin' to figure it out.", "You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.", "Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.", "I want you out of here! I want you out of here!", "Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!", "No kidding. NO KIDDING!", "I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!", "You're lower than a dog!", "Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.", "Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!", "You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.", "You're not takin' Amy.", "You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.", "Get out of here!", "Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.", "You threw it away?", "I put her to bed.", "So, who'd you go to lunch with?", "And where'd you go?", "What'd you have?", "What did Jennifer have?", "Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.", "You know why I want to do it. Just do it.", "Mm.", "Who were you with?", "I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.", "...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done. What if he won't stop?", "I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...", "...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?", "I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-", "I should have -", "Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.", "Listen to me.", "Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.", "You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.", "You fuckin' whore!", "You understand? What? Let you go?", "You want your jewelry?", "And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...", "Get - Get up! Get up!", "Get - get up!", "Get up! Get going!  Get up!", "Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.", "Now you need approval from him to go home?", "You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.", "She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.", "Just wait there for me!", "Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -", "You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.", "You'll wake the whole neighborhood!", "I'm not -", "I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -", "Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -", "I'm afraid to let her in the house.", "I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.", "Should I let her in like - ?", "If she calms down, I will let her in the house.", "If she calms down...", "After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.", "They had all the pieces they needed.", "What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?", "Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -", "- you could put 'em on your expense account?", "Bullshit! Bullshit!", "We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.", "...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -", "How many kids do you have?", "Eight children!", "That's amazing.", "Mr Rothstein.", "What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.", "What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.", "These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.", "The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.", "Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?", "Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.", "Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?", "Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?", "You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?", "Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!", "Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.", "The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?", "You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?", "Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.", "I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -", "I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.", "Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.", "...worst possible time for me.", "I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance. That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.", "Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.", "Green?", "We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over. I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?", "Can't do it with both hands?", "Can you do it with your left hand?", "So, you're a righty?", "All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?", "Excuse me.", "Is this yours? Your pen?", "I ju- Well, it's a nice pen.

You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.

What are you telling me?", "Then put me on the board.", "I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.

The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.

I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject...\" Listen to this, I actually said this. \"That's not the subject of our evening together.\" Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. \"Now I want you to sign.\"  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? \"My arm's getting tired?\" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.", "Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: \"Now is the time.\"  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together.", "Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...", "...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.", "And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of \"marshaling your sales force...\" What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.

As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.", "The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.", "Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...", "...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.", "Your agent said she would tell her you were okay.

Would \"great\" be insulting?", "I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true.

What's the ceiling that dago painted?", "Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...", "For a while I thought I might go crazy.", "I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.

I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.", "It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more.

What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.", "You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?", "I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER!

You murdered my Misery.", "What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?", "You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.", "I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.", "But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said \"I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way.\"", "Yes.", "Yes.", "I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.", "Then light the match, Paul.", "So you've indicated. Do it.", "I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.", "Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.", "As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.", "I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?", "Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?", "See, isn't this nice?", "And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.", "Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.", "That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.", "Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.", "I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.", "Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...", "I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.", "Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.", "And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an \"n.\" I told the saleslady \"n\" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.", "You--fooler...!  Did I do good?", "But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.", "Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?", "Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?", "Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.", "What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? \"You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie.\" Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.", "Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?", "Poor dear...

Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.", "Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.", "That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...", "I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, \"This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--\"", "\"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!\"", "But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any \"experimental blood transfusion\" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.", "What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.", "Don't be silly. Of course you can.", "You can--you have the \"gotta\"--", "The \"gotta.\" Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the \"gotta.\"", "You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, \"I 'gotta' know will she live,\" \"I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer.\" \"I gotta see how this chapter ends.\" You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.", "What?", "You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--", "I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!", "Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the \"n\"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?", "Will she still love him with that special perfect love?", "Not even a hint?", "Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?", "I'm going to play my records all day", "Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.", "I hope you like it.", "Oh...", "My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.", "A toast?", "To Misery.", "Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.", "Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.", "You really think so?", "Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?", "Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?", "Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.", "The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.", "When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.", "The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.", "That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.", "Paul, I know you've been out.", "You've been out of your room.", "Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.", "Now don't fuss, Paul.", "Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.", "Don't talk to me like that.", "Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?", "I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--", "That's disgusting.", "But the time is now. Soon others will come.", "Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.", "The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?", "This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?", "It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.", "Paul, this will be our legacy.", "Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.", "What things?", "I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.", "Yes, Paul.", "Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me.

I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?", "I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.", "Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?", "Do you love me?", "Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,", "Not yet.", "Can't it go to any office?", "Tell me now.", "Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.", "Okay.", "Is that how you answer the phone?", "Who did it?", "You didn't say what it was for, did you?", "Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?", "And what's the mysterious code word?", "What?", "Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?", "Hello...", "It's me.", "Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...", "Maybe.", "It's nothin' like that.", "Maybe.", "Jimmy... it's beautiful!", "Why now, Jimmy?", "I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.", "Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.", "Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?", "Oh yeah.", "Yes.", "In the back?", "Am I in trouble?", "You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.", "No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.", "Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?", "You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.", "I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.", "And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.", "Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.", "We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.", "In case of what?", "Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.", "It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.", "How come he let you go?", "Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.", "Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.", "We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.", "I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.", "Thelma!", "I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.", "Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.", "Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?", "Maybe.", "Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.", "I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.", "Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?", "Exactly.", "Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.", "Get the car.", "Get the car!", "West.  Left.", "I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.", "Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?", "Which part?", "Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!", "We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?", "It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?", "We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.", "If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.", "It means shut up, Thelma.", "We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?", "Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.", "Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.", "Just what the hell is wrong with you?", "Why are you actin' like this?", "You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.", "Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...", "You're not touchin' that car.", "Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.", "I think better when I drive.", "Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...", "No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.", "I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.", "I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.", "Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.", "Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?", "Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.", "I don't know.  I won't be.", "It's probably not a good idea.", "What did Darryl say?", "I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.", "I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.", "You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.", "Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?", "He's got a lot to be proud of.", "That's puttin' it mildly.", "He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.", "Thelma kinda took to him.", "He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.", "Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.", "I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.", "Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.", "How do I look?", "Have another drink, Thelma.", "What happened to your hair?", "What's wrong with you?", "Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.", "I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.", "Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.", "Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.", "I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?", "You left that guy alone in the room?", "Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.", "No.", "What happened?", "Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!", "Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?", "Holy shit.", "For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.", "No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!", "You think you've found your calling?", "You're disturbed.", "So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?", "Litterbug.", "They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.", "Thelma.", "I want you to call Darryl.", "To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.", "Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!", "But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!", "It won't work.", "No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.", "Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.", "Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.", "That J.D. kid is a little shit.", "How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?", "You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!", "Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!", "Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!", "Just past Boise City.", "Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.", "Now what what?", "Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.", "Yeah.", "You mean now or before?", "I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.", "You know those little dogs you see people with?", "Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?", "Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?", "I can see that.", "Well, now, maybe you won't have to.", "Gosh.  It sure is.", "Well, you got it now.", "Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.", "Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.", "What?", "What?  What's not funny, Thelma!", "What?!", "What?!  What about him?!", "Now, Thelma, that is not...", "Thelma!", "I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...", "I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!", "I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.", "About how fast was I going?", "I am really sorry about this.", "What?", "Sorry!", "Ready?", "I believe you.", "Yes.", "Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.", "I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.", "I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.", "And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.", "You do?", "Yeah.", "Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.", "I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.", "What'd I say again?", "What?", "I said all that?", "Whatever.", "Yes, Thelma?", "What do you mean?", "No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.", "Thelma, that is not an option.", "I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.", "He said they're charging us with murder.", "And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.", "Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?", "Well, let me know when you figure it out.", "You could call it that.  My eyes are open.", "Good.", "We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.", "We can live in a hacienda.", "Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?", "It would have to be pretty damn good.", "We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.", "It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.", "And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...", "Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.", "You know what's happened, don't you?", "We've gone insane.", "Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.", "About two hundred and fifty miles.", "Shit!", "Shit!", "What?!  What d'you think?!", "We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.", "They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!", "There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.", "You're crazy.", "You too, sweetie, the best.", "No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.", "Unbearable, I'd imagine.", "How do you stay so positive?", "What?!", "Where?!", "It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!", "It's grand!", "All this for us?", "We're not giving up, Thelma.", "What are you talkin' about?", "Go?", "You, too, sweetie, the best.", "You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.", "You got that right.", "Say you're sorry."]}, "u4065": {"character_name": "WALTER", "movie_id": "m269", "movie_name": "the big lebowski", "gender": "male", "mbti": "extrovert, sensor, thinker, judger", "biography": ["I am owner of Sobchak Security; I use the combat knowledge I accumulated during the Vietnam War.", "I am divorced from ex wife Cynthia after five years of marriage.", "I live in Southern California.", "I spend most of my time at the local bowling alley, and picking fights with those who don't respect the rules.", "I am stubborn, aggressive, and a mentally unhinged believer in rules.", "I am interested in bowling, Judaism, and handguns.", "I watch Cynthia's dog when she\u2019s out of town, I haven\u2019t totally moved on.", "I converted to Judaism for Cynthia and stuck with my new religion after the relationship ended.", "I have to help my friend The Dude through a sticky situation.", "While my tour of duty prepared me for a career in security, it also left me paranoid and angry."], "paraphrasis_1": ["I own Sobchak Security and draw upon my experiences in the Vietnam War for combat strategy.", "I was married to Cynthia for five years, but we are now divorced.", "Southern California is my home.", "I can often be found at the bowling alley or starting arguments with those who defy the rules.", "I am a strong-willed, aggressive, and unbalanced individual who values rules above all else.", "I enjoy bowling, practicing Judaism, and shooting guns.", "When Cynthia is out of town, I take care of her dog and am not completely over our breakup.", "I converted to Judaism for Cynthia and have continued to follow the religion even after our relationship ended.", "I need to assist my friend The Dude through a difficult situation.", "My service in the military prepared me for a career in security, but it also made me anxious and furious."], "paraphrasis_2": ["I am the proprietor of Sobchak Security, where I utilize the fighting skills I gained during the Vietnam War.", "Cynthia and I were married for five years, but we are no longer together.", "I reside in Southern California.", "I spend a lot of my time either bowling or instigating conflicts with rule-breakers.", "I am an uncompromising, bellicose, and unstable person with an obsession with rules.", "My hobbies include bowling, Judaism, and firearms.", "I watch Cynthia's dog when she's away and am still emotionally attached to her.", "I converted to Judaism for Cynthia and have retained my faith even after our split.", "It is my responsibility to help my friend The Dude navigate a troublesome situation.", "My time in the military equipped me for a career in security, but it also left me with paranoia and anger."], "conversations": ["There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.
